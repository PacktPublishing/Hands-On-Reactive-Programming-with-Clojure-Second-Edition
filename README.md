**Create asynchronous, event-based, and concurrent applications**

## What is this book about?
Reactive Programming is central to many concurrent systems, and can help make the process of developing highly concurrent, event-driven, and asynchronous applications simpler and less error-prone.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Understand how to think in terms of time-varying values and event streams 
* Create, compose, and transform observable sequences using Reactive extensions 
* Build a CES framework from scratch using core.async as its foundation 
* Develop a simple ClojureScript game using Reagi 
* Integrate Om and RxJS in a web application 
* Implement a reactive API in Amazon Web Services (AWS) 
* Discover helpful approaches to backpressure and error handling 
* Get to grips with futures and their applications

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
(fn [ctx val] 
  (-> ctx 
      canvas/save 
      (canvas/translate (:x val) (:y val)) 
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
